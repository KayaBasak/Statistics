# 📊 A Gentle Introduction to Probability & Statistics

This repository contains my notes, Google Colab notebooks, and supporting materials for learning and revisiting **probability and statistics** from an intuition-first perspective.

The goal of this repository is not to be overly mathematical, but to build a **clear mental model** for key statistical ideas using explanations, simulations, and visualizations in Python.

## ✍️ Medium Blog Series

These notebooks are designed to **complement** my Medium blog series, where I explain the concepts in more detail and from a conceptual point of view.
